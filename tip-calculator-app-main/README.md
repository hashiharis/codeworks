## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript
- OOP's concept-Class, constructors , Prototypal Inheritance
- Validatiopn for each field

### What I learned

Through this project, I learned to apply Prototypal inheritance, I tried to design multiple classes using constructor. The tip calculator app is designed in a way, to learn the Javascript OOP's and inheritance concepts. Apart from vanilla JS, tried to apply ES6+ syntax as much as possible.
